# Environment Variables
You can find an example of the environment variables inside `'.example.env'`, please copy everything from inside that file into a new file called `'.env'` and configure it to your liking (if you change the ports then you will need to configure the docker files too).

# Commands
## Basic commands
- ` yarn build ` Builds both server & client inside of the 'release/' directory
- ` yarn start ` Starts the server in production mode 
- ` yarn dev ` Starts the server in development mode, this is the main command to use when developing on this

## More commands
- ` yarn sv_build ` Builds the server 
- ` yarn cl_build ` Builds the client 
- ` yarn sv_dev ` Starts server in development mode, if theres a build of the client then it will use that in     production mode 
- ` yarn cl_dev ` Starts the client in development mode, only really useful if you're only to work on the styles

## Docker commands
- ` yarn docker_build ` Creates an image of the server and nginx
- ` yarn deploy ` Uses the images that were built and deploys it to a container using nginx to host the server

## Formatting and Checking
- ` yarn format ` Uses prettier to format the server & client code
- ` yarn lint:fix ` Uses eslint and goes through the server & client code

# Configurations
## Server
- The Typescript configuration file for the server is called `tsconfig.server.json`.
## Client
- The Typescript configuration file for the server is called `tsconfig.json` and there is also a custom configuration file for react/react-scripts and they can be found inside `config-overrides.js`.
## Docker
- The main Docker file can be found at `express-boilerplate/Dockerfile` and this is for the `express-boilerplate-server` image. 
- The Docker file for nginx can be found at `express-boilerplate/nginx/Dockerfile` and will create a image for `express-boilerplate-nginx` so it can manually host the server.
- The Docker compose file can be found at `express-boilerplate/docker-compose.yml` and this is for locally hosting the server using Docker and also uses the built Docker images listed above.
